Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I am writing to you today to apply for the open position of social media marketing manager. My colleague told me about the job opening and has offered to provide a letter of reference. 

I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in digital media from Northern State University and three years experience as a social media assistant at Glamour Boxx. During my time at Glamour Box I have learned how best to utilize all forms of social media, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. 

For the past year I have been responsible for managing the Glamour Box Instagram account and since my hiring our engagement numbers increased by 35 percent. 

Additionally, I enjoy working with like-minded people and I am ready to take on a management position in your company. I love a challenge and I know I can help take your social media presence to the next level. 

Thank you for your time and for considering me for the position. I have included my resume and will follow up with an email next week to see if I can offer any more information.

Sincerely,
