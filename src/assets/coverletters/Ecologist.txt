Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

My name is [Your-Name] and I am interested in the vacancy you advertised today on the [Organization Name] website for a Ecologist. 

I possess all of the competencies you require in a candidate, in particular I want to point out my in depth understanding of ecological issues and my track record of successfully managing related field surveys. I consider myself to be a highly motivated, passionate and committed Ecologist who has a methodical approach to work and an ability to accurately gather and interpret data. 

Currently I work for .......... in a role where I provide specialist ecological support, carry out environmental assessments and give environmental advice to those who ask for it. I also play a critical role within the company in developing and delivering the strategic communications framework needed to build and engage with stakeholders. 

As you can see from my attached CV I have experience of driving energy efficiency initiatives, promoting renewable energy generation, helping to cut energy bills, and reducing fuel poverty. 

Furthermore, I must mention that through my career I have learnt how to manage time, work independently and cope with multiple priorities. In addition to this I am sociable by nature, can get along with others, appreciate differences and work hard to create a positive working environment. 

For me it would be an honour to be a part of and contribute to a company like yours. I therefore hope you will look favourably upon my application, and I look forward to hearing from you in regards to an interview.

Sincerely,
