Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Assistant Buyer position that your company advertised today on the [Organization Name] website. 

I come to you with a proven ability to research suppliers and markets for newer and better quality materials for your company. You can rely on me to source, negotiate and buy goods or services that will meet your company's operational requirements. 

Since July 2016 I have been working for ..........., where I have been part of the company's purchasing department, and actively involved in all of its buying activities. One of my duties is to act as a key client contact, developing and maintaining strong relationships with suppliers. I am proud to say that my efforts have had a direct impact on the success and profitability of the company. 

Aside from my technical competencies I am also a well organised individual with a confident and outgoing personality who when required to can successfully deputise for senior buyers. I must also point out my superb focus and attention to detail, both skills which greatly help me to recognise when products are not of an acceptable quality. 

I would very much welcome a personal meeting with you to discuss your needs and my ability to meet them. My schedule is flexible and I am available for interview during the day, evening and at the weekend. I thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
