Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I wish to apply for the position of Head of Operations that was advertised today on the [Organization Name] website. 

I can lead multi-skilled teams to ensure that every aspect of a business runs smoothly. 

I bring to the table my extensive experience of working in an operational management role. In addition to this I have a proven track record of working to strict time scales, and of contributing to the successful development of a company. Furthermore, I am very good at helping staff be the best they can be. 

At the moment I work for ..........., where I am responsible for labour efficiency, operational effectiveness and maximising the profit of projects. I am an integral member of the operations team, and have played an instrumental role in the growth plans for a key part of the business. As part of my job I write executive reports and strategy documents on complex operational issues. I am also involved in establishing systems, structures and responsibilities for those I manage. 

After reviewing my attached CV you will quickly see my ability to operate at a senior level and deal confidently with stakeholders. However, what my attached CV cannot illustrate is my penchant for holding technical conversations and my competency at influencing peers and senior managers to achieve desired results. 

Having attained most of the career goals that I set out to achieve, I now want to work for a company like yours that has a fast-paced, challenging environment which can provide me with a rewarding and stimulating career. If you require any further information, please get in touch. In any event, I look forward to hearing from you as the recruitment process progresses.

Sincerely,
