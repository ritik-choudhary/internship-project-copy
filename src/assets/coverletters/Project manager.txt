Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I’m excited to be applying for the Project Manager position at [Organization Name]. As someone with an eye for detail and impulse for organization, I thrive on keeping projects running smoothly from kickoff through launch. I’m eager for the opportunity to use my talents to move technology forward with [Organization Name]’s innovative software systems. 

During my previous role at Clean-World, I worked on many of the company’s critical projects, including the redesign of our flagship CRM system. When an external issue derailed a crucial project milestone, I developed an all-team triage system to ensure other project sprints could continue moving forward. As a result, the updated system went live within five days of the original planned launch – an effort the CEO praised as “heroic and unprecedented.” I earned specific recognition for my ability to effectively delegate and keep myself and my teammates calm under pressure. 

My experience working with cross-functional, international teams has taught me the importance of building trusted relationships and inspiring a shared project vision. I can bring to [Organization Name] real-world experience in developing successful project plans, communicating expectations clearly, and encouraging team enthusiasm, even in the late stages of the project cycle. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more about the Project Manager position and about [Organization Name]. I believe my skills as a Project Manager will be a significant asset for your team’s current and future needs. I am committed to continuing to grow as a leader and applying my talents to help [Organization Name] lead the industry in creating innovative software solutions.

Sincerely,
