Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

My name is ...........â€¦ and I am interested in your current vacancy for a Microbiologist which I saw advertised today on the [Organization Name] website. 

I am an intellectually curious and passionate individual who sets myself high standards and who has a proven track record in research project management to agreed deadlines, budgets and quality standards. 

I possess strong analytical, quantitative and organisational skills, including the ability to manage complex and varied workloads. In addition to this I have excellent communication skills including the ability to write insightful and detailed reports to specification and time. 

In my current role, I work as part of a team that networks and liaises with staff from other departments and external agencies. At work, I am primarily involved in the sampling and testing of microbiological samples and also in the preparation of materials for testing. 

I come to you with a degree in Microbiology, as well as knowledge and experience of clean room environmental monitoring and of water sampling/testing techniques. 

Right now, I am looking for a suitable position with a company like yours that empowers its staff and gives them responsibility, lets them spread their wings, whilst at the same time supporting them. 

I have attached my most recent CV with this letter and would be grateful if you would review it. If you feel I have the potential that you are looking for in a candidate then please do not hesitate to contact me to arrange an interview.

Sincerely,
