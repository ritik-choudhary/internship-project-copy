Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I would like to apply for your recently advertised Academic Tutor vacancy which I saw today on the [Organization Name] website. 

The high ambition I maintain for all of my students is reflected in the standards that I set for myself. 

I have the necessary technical skills, experience and specialist knowledge needed to provide a nurturing classroom and academy environment that helps my pupils to develop as learners. You can rely on me to develop strong relationships with my students and give them the time, resources and support needed to deliver an exceptional experience. 

At the moment, I work for .........., in a role where I am involved in planning and delivering lessons to the highest standards so that real learning takes place and students make genuine progress in their studies. As part of my duties, I look for ways that can improve and challenge poor performance, something I do by providing regular commentary, feedback and assessment to those that need it. 

I consider myself an assertive and dynamic individual who has the confidence needed to engage with experienced multi-disciplinary teams. I always work hard to establish effective working relationships and to set a good example through my own professional conduct. 

Right now, I am keen to become a key player in a cutting-edge organisation like yours, that pursues excellence in everything it does, and which energises and inspires its staff through the standards it sets. Please find attached my CV which gives more details of my career and also future potential. I thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from.
