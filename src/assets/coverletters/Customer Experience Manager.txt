Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

Your newly created position for a Customer Experience Manager, which I saw today on the [Organization Name] website, would suit a driven professional like me who thrives in a fast paced environment. 

With my previous experience in improving customer experience and my expertise at leading, guiding and supporting junior staff to success, I feel I would be an ideal candidate for the position. 

I have all of the skills required to do the job well, in particular I want to highlight my ability to advise Senior Executives on customer satisfaction measures and customer experience strategies. 

I know what works and what doesn't. I have a track record of achieving meaningful outcomes which help improve the customers overall experience. I achieve results by having a long term strategic focus, balanced against the need for immediate results. 

Aside from my technical competencies, I am a true team player who can lead and motivate high performing people and staff through organisational and cultural change. Furthermore, I am someone who will always ensure that others have a working understanding of the legislation and policy framework within which they should operate. 

In addition to this letter I have also attached my current resume which will give you a more comprehensive idea of my competencies. 

Finally I must mention that I have heard many good reports about your company and I would like to be part of your team. If you feel there is a mutual interest, I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to learn more about your company and the requirements of the vacancy.

Sincerely,
