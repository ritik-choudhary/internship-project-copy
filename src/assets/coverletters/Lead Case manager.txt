Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I wish to apply for the position of Lead Case Manager that was advertised today on the [Organization Name] website. 

I have a high degree of maturity, strong inter-personal skills and the ability to work with low socio-economic and diverse populations facing crisis situations, all in a professional and diplomatic manner. 

As a capable manager I have no trouble harnessing the support of a committed and loyal workforce. Furthermore, and on a personal level I have confidence in own decision making and can make important decisions about sensitive cases. 

In my current role I use my intellectual and analytical skills to apply complex legislation to a variety of circumstances. I make judgements on the basis of reports as well as other evidence, and ensure that there is no conflict of interest or appearance of bias. In addition to this I provide a primary point of contact and liaison for both inside and outside the department in a way that delivers an effective service to those who need it. 

Through my career I have gained professional experience of working with multi-cultural clients, community members and other agencies. I have also learnt how to interpret relevant guidance documents and standards and complete written performance evaluations. 

Right now I would like to work for an organisation that values diversity and wants its workforce to reflect the communities that it serves. I have attached my most current CV with this letter for your kind consideration. If you require any further information, please get in touch. In any event, I look forward to hearing from you as the recruitment process progresses.

Sincerely,
