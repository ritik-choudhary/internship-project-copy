Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I would like to be considered for the role of Training Coordinator which I saw advertised yesterday on the .......... website. 

I come to you as a capable professional who can be relied upon to design and expand training and development programs based on the needs of any business, organization or individual. I will always produce training material that is of the highest standards and that fully complies with all regulatory and company standards. 

After reviewing my attached resume you will quickly see that I am someone who can maintain the quality and consistency of course content throughout a course life cycle. 

In my current position, my main role is to implement workforce development programs that will improve employee skills. I do this by working in close partnership with the Learning and Development Trainer, Advisor and Manager. 

On a more personal level I can work flexibly according to the needs of a business. In addition to this I possess superb communication skills that allow me to build rapport with employees at all levels and engage with people at all levels. 

Right now, my ambition is to join a company like yours that is powered by great people and led by inspired leaders. 

I look forward to meeting with you to further discuss my application and to also explain to you in person what I can bring to your organisation.

Sincerely,
