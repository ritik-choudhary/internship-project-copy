Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

Without wishing to sound boastful, I am sure that you will be delighted to hear from someone like me who can maximise your chances of winning bids at commercially sustainable rates. 

After reading your job description I quickly realised the match between your requirements and my ability to create detailed assessments of bid components. I can bring to the table my experience of Identifying risks associated with tendering opportunities. 

I come to you as a highly ambitious and talented professional who is keen to join a winning company like yours that is ready to face the future and lead the way. I believe that your company works on the basis that if you look after the interests of the company, then the company will after you. 

To my mind a good Bid Writer should be someone who can maintain, coordinate and communicate an awareness of markets and competitors. I can do this and much more. 

With my present employer I have contributed to their business growth by writing professional proposal content that clearly articulates their bids value proposition. I regularly chair Bid team meetings, preparing meeting agendas and make presentations to the bid team. My present employer is very satisfied with my work rate, and I am confident that I can bring the same level of high performance to your company. 

In addition to this letter I have also attached my current resume which will give you a more comprehensive idea of my competencies. 

If acceptable, I will contact you next week to confirm your receipt of my application, however please free to contact me if you require clarification or any further information.

Sincerely,
