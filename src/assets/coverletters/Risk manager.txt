Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I saw your advert for a Risk Manager on the [Organization Name] website and am eager to apply for the position. 

I will make sure that your business is always in safe hands by helping you anticipate and manage potential risks and threats. I am someone who looks at potential threats from every angle, right from the physical environment to the human element and the role of technology. 

With a passion for Health and Safety, you can rely on me to get to the root cause of a threat, rather than just deal with its symptoms. I can draw on a wealth of experience from my past jobs to communicate the benefits of risk management to a sceptical workforce. 

As a proven operator, I possess all of those skills that you are looking for in a candidate. Chief amongst these is my ability to, embed risk management within your company's culture, and to break down behaviour barriers that are preventing the successful implementation of risk management strategies and processes. 

With my present employer, ..........., I have a reputation for not only highlighting potential hazards but also for coming up with real, practical solutions to overcome them. Working as part of a busy team, I regularly identify risks that could have an impact on the company. I avoid loss or damage by keeping things simple, and by creating procedures that work effectively in the setting in which they are used. 

On a personal level, I am someone who is willing to work hard and who is happy to be pushed to achieve more. 

At the moment my ambition is to join a company like yours that has a reputation for encouraging people to realise their goals and be proud of their achievements. To this end I very much hope that you will look favourably upon my application, and I eagerly await to hear back from you.

Sincerely,
