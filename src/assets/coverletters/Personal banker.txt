Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

Your recent on the [Organization Name] website for a Personal Banker caught my eye as it appeared to be a perfect match for my experience, skills and future potential. 

I am a competitive, tenacious and career-hungry individual who is able to sell to blue chip clients, source new clients and increase revenues from an existing client base. You can rely on me to positively contribute to your team, bank and community. 

With my practical experience of wealth management, I can arrange events for advisors to high net worth individuals, investment managers, lawyers, accountants, private asset managers, trustees and family offices. I have the required experience, training, knowledge and formal qualifications to source, profile, approach and meet with all types of prospective bank clients. 

In my current role I get to know my clients, who they are, what drives them and what they want. I then identify and properly match financial products to their precise needs. In addition to this I also advise both front office staff and back room teams on a mixture of banking transactional and compliance issues. Over the past 5 years, I have built up a lot of experience within the finance industry which I believe gives me a competitive advantage when approaching top calibre clients. 

On a personal level I have excellent grammar and command of English, as well as the soft skills needed for networking, presenting and interviewing. In addition to this I am a sociable person who will always be at office parties, team building events, and Friday afternoon drinks. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my application, I will take the liberty of calling you in a few days time to arrange an interview at a time that is mutually convenient to both of us.

Sincerely,
