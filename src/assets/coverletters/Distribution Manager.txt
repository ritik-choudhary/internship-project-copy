Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I would like to express my interest in applying for your vacant Distribution Manager position. 

Your role has a definite correlation with my ability to ensure that the right products are delivered to the right location at the right time. You will be able to see from my attached CV that I am someone who can effectively manage distribution departments costs and performance over both the short and long term. 

For the last three years I have been employed as a Distribution Manager by .........., where I lead a highly effective operation managing multiple distribution centres across the country. These hubs distribute directly to customers, and operate very high levels of service in a time critical environment. At work, I play a major part in resolving problems and in spotting, mentoring and growing future leaders from with the Distribution Centre. 

During my career I have gained exposure to multi-site management and have learnt how to spot areas that can be improved. 

Aside from all of the above, I am a highly confident person in my own right, and have the ability to building relationships and trust with colleagues at all levels. 

In view of all of the above I would be grateful if you would consider me for this key vacancy. I would appreciate an opportunity to meet personally to discuss how my abilities and existing contacts will be useful and helpful to your company. 

Please let me know if I can provide you with any other information or references. I thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
