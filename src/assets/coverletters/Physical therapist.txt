Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I’m excited to be applying for the Physical Therapist position at Clean-World. I am passionate about combining my knowledge of physiology with my clinical and interpersonal skills to create successful therapy plans and improve the overall patient experience. 

During my previous role at [Organization Name], I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of patients, including pediatric, adolescent, and special needs patients. I owned the development and implementation of effective pain management and mobility improvement plans for more than 150 patients. I was also responsible for developing and overseeing the company’s first in-home care program, which now produces almost 50% of [Organization Name]’s revenue. 

In addition to my experience in delivering quality patient care, I have also taken on additional roles as a trainer and educator for new physical therapists. I developed a new hire training curriculum that reduced the onboarding period from 14 days to 9 days, and I spearheaded an innovative continuing education program that improved employee retention rates by 67%. This love of teaching also led me to create a personal blog showcasing proven techniques for improving bedside manner and enhancing patient relationships. The blog currently has more than 1,000 subscribers, ranging from first-year medical students to seasoned physical therapists. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Physical Therapist position and about Clean-World. My passion for helping people aligns well with Clean-World’s mission to provide comprehensive, compassionate care, and I’m eager for the opportunity to discuss how my extensive experience can best be used to produce successful patient outcomes.

Sincerely,
