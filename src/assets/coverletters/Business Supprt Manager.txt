Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

A business is only as good as the people it employs, and without wishing to sound boastful I believe that I am the best candidate for your recently advertised Business Support Manager vacancy. 

I come to you as a dedicated, highly motivated and professional Business Support Manager who has the ability to develop strategic operating plans that reflect the longer term objectives and priorities of a company. 

Given my extensive training, background and competency at formulating and implementing policy, I believe I can help your company to meet its obligations to its customers. I will do this by identifying areas where improvements can be made, coming up with solutions and then ensuring these upgrades and actioned. In addition to this I will also work with colleagues to pool resources, skills and knowledge so that everyone pushes in the same direction. 



During my career, I have learnt how to meet multiple demands in a fast paced environment. At my current place of work I have been commended for ensuring the best possible outcomes for the department and for ensuring that the highest standard or service is being provided to customers. 

At this stage in my career, I want to work for a company like yours where no day is ever the same, and where I will have a varied workload which will broaden my current knowledge. To help you make a decision on my application I have attached my most recent CV with this letter. 

Finally, thank you very much for your time, consideration and hopefully forthcoming positive response. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.

Sincerely,
