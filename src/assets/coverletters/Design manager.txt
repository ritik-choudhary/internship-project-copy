Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I noticed your advertisement on the [some-website.com] website for a Design Manager and think I would make an excellent candidate for it. 

I have extensive experience of managing a large design team, and possess the ability to motivate, inspire and steer them in the right direction. You can be assured that anything I get my staff to design will meet set costs, deadlines and quality requirements. 

I can come up with cost effective design solutions that are carefully considered and expertly crafted. I possess strong knowledge of current design techniques and contemporary software and have a track record of working to tight timescales in high pressure situations. You can also rely on me to drive excellence in health and safety matters, thereby ensuring that risks are minimised in the design process. 

At the moment I work for .........., where I lead a design team together with a development team to ensure the delivery of new designs from the concept stage right through to development. At work I am renowned for being a proactive manager who actively escalates any potential issues before they become more serious problems. 

On a personal level, I possess a confident demeanour along with the ability to liaise with all levels of personnel. Furthermore, I am someone who is calm by nature and who can think on my feet in a range of emergency situations. 

Right now, I would like to work for a company like yours where I can learn more and advance my skills further. 

I enclose a copy of my CV and hope that you will look favourably upon my application. Thank you for your time, consideration and forthcoming response.

Sincerely,
