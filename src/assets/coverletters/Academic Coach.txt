Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name]'s Last-Name], 

I believe that something remarkable happens when you bring together people who are committed to making a difference, they do! 

I would like to express my interest in applying for your vacant Academic Coach position, a role I feel I am perfectly qualified for. The vacancy has a definite correlation with my ability to mentor, guide, and support students. Indeed, I come to you as a capable individual can who turn pupils into tolerant, responsible and successful individuals who leave school feeling confident and happy about themselves. 

You can see from my attached CV that I am a committed team-player who has a long track record of working with colleagues to promote best and innovative practices that enrich the range of teaching and learning styles within a school. As a sticker for the rules, I always set high standards of behaviour and discipline for those I coach, and can be relied upon to strictly enforce program policies and procedures. To date, I feel my strongest competency is my ability when required, to communicate and make contact with parents to discuss their child's behaviour. 

At the moment I work at .......... in a team-based, fast moving, detail-oriented environment. As well as promoting and organise a range of curricular and extracurricular activities, I am also involved in assemblies, trips, evening acting classes and after school clubs. 

I am aware of your company's excellent reputation and am keep to join a company like yours that has committed coaches who are looking to grow their careers with the same amount of energy and drive that I have. 

In view of all of the above I would be very grateful if you were to consider me for your opening, and I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you in person to discuss how my application.

Sincerely,
