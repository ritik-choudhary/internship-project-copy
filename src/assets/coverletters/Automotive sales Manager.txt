Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

This letter is in response to your online advertisement on the [Organization Name] website for an Automotive Sales Manager position. 

I possess all of the competencies you require from a candidate. I have the entrepreneurial zeal and creative flair needed to explore ideas for fresh and unusual advertising campaigns, across various media platforms. I come to you as a self-starter with the drive, commercial acumen and self-discipline required to consistently hit sales targets and steadily grow my sector's revenues. 

In my current role, my style is to delegate as much as I can, leaving me free to manage at a higher level. I empower staff in every way possible to help them break through barriers to get sales. I am also involved in devising marketing plans, setting sales targets and analysing sales figures. 

I am a process-oriented individual with a proven track record within car sales management. My success to date is due to my obsession with talking to customers to identify their unique needs, and my ability to build relationships with key customers. 

I have extensive experience of motivating teams to achieve their targets. 

At this moment in time I am keen to work for a company like yours that gives its employees plenty of resources to plan and expand for the future. I am sure that you will give me all the support and training I need, not just when I first join, but on an ongoing basis. 

In closing I would like to stress how keen I am to schedule an interview with you at your convenience. Please do not hesitate to contact me to arrange one.

Sincerely,
