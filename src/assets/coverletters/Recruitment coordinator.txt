Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

I would like to apply for your recently advertised Recruitment Coordinator vacancy which I saw on the [Organization Name] website. 

I feel confident that my three years solid experience of managing the full recruitment cycle makes me an ideal candidate for your position. Through my career I have become an expert at selecting the perfect candidate through screening application forms, conducting professional telephone interviews, responding to enquiry emails and judging a candidate's potential. 

You can rely on me to recruit, develop and retaining the very best people. I will be involved in every aspect of the recruitment process from planning right through to execution. Whatever I do I will always place the needs of the candidate and prospective employer at the very heart of my work. 

At the moment, I work for .........., in a role similar to the one you are trying to fill. At work, I am involved in uploading vacancies onto job boards and websites and then calling potential candidates to see whether they are suitable for the position. 

I consider myself a confident communicator who can tactfully deal with sensitive situations, such as notifying candidates that they were not selected for open positions. 

Right now, I am keen to become a key player in a cutting-edge recruitment company like yours, where I will have the opportunity to work for a wide-range of worldwide recognised brands. I would really appreciate an opportunity to further discuss your needs and my application and suitability. Please feel free to contact me to set up a mutually convenient time and date for an interview. 

I thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from.

Sincerely,
