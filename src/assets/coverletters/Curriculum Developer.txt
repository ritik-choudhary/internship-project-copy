Dear Mr/Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

My name is [Your-Name] and I am interested in your current vacancy for a Curriculum Developer. 

I understand the problems and needs of teachers as well as learners, and have the ability to create curriculums that will challenge pupils and engage their interest. 

I can raise standards in a subject area by developing curriculums that will set learning targets for pupils based on their prior attainment. I consider myself a bold thinker and standout innovator who can motivate other to explore new frontiers in a learning environment that supports and inspires them to be better. Through the use of a wide range of strategies I am able to design curriculums that educate people and promote the better use of teaching and learning resources. 

In my current role I work as part of the central team responsible for creating curriculums, producing written guidance and creating processes. Aside from this I also advise students and their parents on all matters concerning their studies, examinations and progression. 

On a personal level I am a positive, highly-organised and engaging individual who has the confidence and communication skills needed to connect with others. Furthermore, I hold a long list of teaching qualification, a relevant degree and have a clear vision of what constitutes outstanding practice. 

Currently I am looking to join a dynamic, rapidly growing organisation where there is a genuine understanding and appreciation of each otherâ€™s differences. I have attached my most current CV with this letter. I would like the opportunity to discuss my skills and abilities in more detail with you and am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
