Dear Mr./Ms. [Hiring Manager's Last-Name], 

Whilst browsing through the [Organization Name] website, I saw your advert for the position of a Parts Advisor and immediately realized that I was a perfect match for it. 

I possess extensive experience gained within the motor industry, along with a good knowledge of vehicle layout, function and the location of parts. I am someone who can quickly establish a customers' needs for required parts through conversations, diagnosis and recommendations as appropriate. 

For the past three years I have worked for .........., where I provide an excellent service supplying parts to customers both over the counter and via the telephone. I ensure that all enquiries are dealt with quickly and efficiently and that all orders are processed on the same day. In addition to this I am also accountable for supporting and assisting colleagues and customers with parts identification and sourcing. 

Other that the above, I am very good at documenting and supervising the condition of parts returned for credit and reporting damaged or unsuitable items to the Parts Supervisor. I would also like to mention that I have the excellent planning and organizational skills needed to be able to priorities a busy workload. 

On a personal level, I am agile in the way I think, and have the ability to adapt to the changing demands of a rapidly growing business. Furthermore, I am someone who is inquisitive by nature and eager to continuously improve and learn, through books, articles and meet-ups. 

Please find attached my CV, and feel free to contact me if you would like more information about my capabilities.

Sincerely,
